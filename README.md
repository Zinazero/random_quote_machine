# A program that can be used to generate a random quote from an array of quote subarrays and then tweet the provided quote. NOTE: This program was written before Twitter became X, so the tweet button is no longer functional. Also, the quote array only holds placeholders, but the functionality works. This program was produced as part of the Front End Development Libraries course on freeCodeCamp.org. Created by Jacob Hexamer.
